The idea for **Oshin** emerged during a multi-day motorcycle trip through the mountainous Ha Giang region
of northern Vietnam. Riding along steep cliffs and winding peaks for four consecutive days, I found myself
immersed in a rare sense of tranquility. As the journey neared its end, I began reflecting on how I could
merge my technical skills with the places and experiences that bring me peace. Raised with a deep appreciation
for the outdoors, I felt inspired to use engineering to preserve the natural environments I love.

### Northern Vietnam

While exploring the Thai Islands and Bali, Indonesia, I was struck by the visible pollution in many of the coastal
waterways. It was disheartening to witness such natural beauty compromised by floating debris. This experience
sparked an idea—perhaps I could apply my background in autonomous robotics to address the problem. I envisioned
a robot capable of autonomously collecting marine trash, designed with affordability in mind to serve rural coastal
communities that often lack access to advanced cleanup technologies.

### Bali

As an engineer with a passion for aviation and RC aircraft, I naturally over-engineered the first prototype.
I spent over 200 hours in a single month refining the CAD design—driven by a desire to get every detail right.

### First Sketches

The next two months were a blur of iteration: design, print, test—then
repeat. Among the most challenging issues was ensuring water tightness. I experimented
with specific PETG blends and TPU seals to keep the electronics dry.

### Early Prototypes

One critical lesson: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D prints are not inherently watertight. The layering process
leaves microscopic gaps that allow water to seep in—something I discovered the hard way.

### Sea Trials

### Autonomy
 
While waiting for parts to print and dry, it seemed like the logical time to start working on the autonomy. Phase 1 goal is to set the project up in ROS2 + Gazebo + PX4/Ardupilot + my Autonomy. We'll be sending offboard commands from my autonomy to PX4. Ideally this will be completely implemented in containers to avoid any local install magic on my machine. Since I would like to amke this a swarm of boats at some point, it makes sense to model each node on its own container. We'll see how that goes.

Phase 2 will include obstacle avoidance with an onboard camera, just to simply route around objects dected while getting from one waypoint to another.
