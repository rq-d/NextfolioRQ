## Inception

Inspiration arrived during a multi-day motorcycle adventure in the mountaineous Ha Giang region
of Northern Vietnam. Riding along steep mountain cliffs, and up/down peaks for four consecutive
days, I found myself in a deep state of peace. Think of the unevitable return to civilization,
my mind wondered how i could use my skills in the context of things I love. Being someone that was
raised outdoors, I meditated on how I could improve the places I love.

### A Problem

While traveling through the Thai Islands and Bali, Indonesia. I couldnt help but notice the lack of
cleanliness in the waterways. I said well, perhaps I could use my experience in autonomous robots to
make an impact. I decided that a robot which could autonomously collect trash in the ocean would be
of value, especially if were affordable to rural coastal towns.

With that in I began doing research of similar products and found one made by a robotics company in
France. I decided this would be a good starting point for a design. The idea being, to make a similar
design but emphasize affordability by using as many off the shelf electronics as possible and take
advantage of accessible additive manufacturing machines. I would go on to design a robot that could
be manufactured with a hobbyist grade 3D Printer, a common RC aircraft autopilot, and consumer grade
marine propulsion.


In classic nerdy engineer fashion, I would go on to over-design and iterate with
obsession. This fixation ended in me contributing at least 200 hours over a one month
period into the CAD alone. This was my first watercraft made from scratch afterall,
my main hobby was RC aircraft.

An iterative cycle of design, print, test, design, print, test would consume the next two months
of my life as I ran into and solved multiple issues. Water tightness would prove to be a challinging one.
I had to use a specific grade of PETG along with TPU to keep water out of the electronics. I also learned
a hard lesson, in that fused deposition modeling does little in the way of providing a physical barrier
between air and water. The resulting structures are simply not homogenous, but contain microscopic gaps
between layers that allow water to pass very quickly (ask me how i know).
