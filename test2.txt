## Inception

The idea for **Oshin** emerged during a multi-day motorcycle trip through the mountainous Ha Giang region of northern Vietnam. Riding along steep cliffs and winding peaks for four consecutive days, I found myself immersed in a rare sense of tranquility. As the journey neared its end, I began reflecting on how I could merge my technical skills with the places and experiences that bring me peace. Raised with a deep appreciation for the outdoors, I felt inspired to use engineering to preserve the natural environments I love.

## Identifying the Problem

While traveling through the Thai Islands and Bali, I was struck by the noticeable pollution in coastal waters. It was disheartening to see such beautiful places marred by floating debris. I began to wonder—could I leverage my background in autonomous robotics to help address this problem?

The idea took shape: design an autonomous, affordable robot capable of collecting surface-level marine trash. The goal was to create something practical and accessible—especially for coastal communities in developing regions.

## Design Inspiration

During my research, I discovered a similar solution developed by a French robotics company. It provided a solid foundation for initial concepts, but I aimed to create a version that emphasized cost-effectiveness and ease of production. My approach centered around:

- Using off-the-shelf electronics
- Relying on hobbyist-grade 3D printers
- Integrating consumer-grade marine components

*Initial concept sketches*

As an engineer with a passion for aviation and RC aircraft, I naturally over-engineered the first prototype. I spent over 200 hours in a single month refining the CAD design—driven by a desire to get every detail right.

## Prototyping and Iteration

The next two months were a blur of iteration: design, print, test—then repeat. Among the most challenging issues was ensuring water tightness. I experimented with specific PETG blends and TPU seals to keep the electronics dry.

One critical lesson: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D prints are not inherently watertight. The layering process leaves microscopic gaps that allow water to seep in—something I discovered the hard way.
